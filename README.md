## Description
The Budget Tracker is an application that allows the user to add and subtract items from a running total. It also displays the information in a graph. 

This tracker can be used offline so it will still allow the user to add and subtract items without an internet connection. All the items added while offline will be added to the database once the internet connection is restored.
  
## Usage
As a user:
I want to be able to keep track of my income and expenses, even if the application is brought offline.

## Installation
This application requires an internet connection up front to load all files (after this it can be brought offline and still used). The npm packages which needed to be installed are all listed in the package.json file under dependencies.
